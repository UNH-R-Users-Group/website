## About Us

Welcome to the **UNH R Users Group!** -- We are a group of faculty and grad students at the University of New Hampshire. Our group is dedicated to teaching and advancing skills in programming, statistics, and data analysis, with a special emphasis on their applications in biology and the life sciences. We provide an inclusive space for graduate students, postdocs, and faculty to explore the programming language R, and other relevant software. Through collaborative workshops, peer-led discussions, and hands-on problem-solving sessions, we aim to enhance proficiency in coding, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Our approach is centered on fostering a supportive learning environment where participants can confidently develop their computational skills and apply them to their research.

In the Fall 2024 semester, we meet on **Mondays 11am-12pm in Spaulding 278**. These meetings are casual, typically consisting of 15-20 minutes of a topic followed by open coding time. The schedule for topics can be found here [Schedule & Resources 2024](schedule.qmd). All UNH grad students and faculty are welcome to attend!
