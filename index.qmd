## About Us

::: grid
::: g-col-7
Welcome to the **UNH R Users Group!** -- We are a group of faculty and grad students at the University of New Hampshire dedicated to teaching and advancing skills in programming, statistics, and data analysis, with a special emphasis on their applications in biology and the life sciences. We provide an inclusive space for graduate students, postdocs, and faculty to explore the programming language R, and other relevant software. Through collaborative workshops, peer-led discussions, and hands-on problem-solving sessions, we aim to enhance proficiency in coding, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Our approach is centered on fostering a supportive learning environment where participants can confidently develop their computational skills and apply them to their research.

In the fall 2025, we will meet Tuesdays from 1:00-2:00pm in TBD (feel free to bring a lunch). Each week will start with a short tutorial followed by open office hours. The list of topics can be found here [Schedule & Resources 2025](schedule.qmd). All UNH grad students and faculty are welcome to attend!
