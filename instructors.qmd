  <h4>Easton White</h4>
  <p><i> (he/him)</i> </p>
  <h6>Assistant Professor<br>
  Department of Biology<br>
  University of New Hampshire (UNH)</h6>

  <p>Dr. Easton White is a quantitative marine ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to answer questions in ecology, conservation science, sustainability, and ecosystem management. Most of his work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. Easton currently conducts research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. His work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them.</p>
